# millet_rust
A Rust implemented tiny blockchain. <br>
It's just a tiny demo of blockchain, maybe missing a lot of features, that because they're in developing, just ignore them.

## Build and Run
```
misc\laboratory\millet_rust$ cargo build
misc\laboratory\millet_rust$ ./millet_rust
```

## Design Overview
Just a reference of [Exonum](https://exonum.com/doc/get-started/design-overview/), which means there are several modules:
* Transaction Processing
* Network Structure
* Consensus
* Data Storage
* Modularity and Services
* Cryptography
